## Find The Mammals (Version 2)

This question is the same prompt as the first question but instead of an array of animal
objects, you have to query a DOM node, a section with a class of ‘all-animals’, which
contains a list of animals

Each animal will be encapsulated in a div with a class of ‘animal’. Inside this div are three
nodes:

- An h2 indicating the type of animal
- A paragraph containing a child span with a class of ‘mammal-value’ that indicates
  whether the animal is a mammal

You should find all mammal nodes and append them as children of the section with a
class of ‘only-mammals’.

What Skills Does This Test?

- An h2 indicating the type of animal
- A paragraph containing a child span with a class of ‘mammal-value’ that indicates
- whether the animal is a mammal
- DOM manipulation
- Iterating through nested DOM elements
