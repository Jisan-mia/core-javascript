### 4 Pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation
  - similar behavior of an object into one place and you can control which property/method you want to be accessed from outside and which you want to be private
- Inheritance
  - inheriting other classes properties and methods
- Abstraction
  - showing user only good interface of a program by hiding complex implementations details
- Polymorphism
