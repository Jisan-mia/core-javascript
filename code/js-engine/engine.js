// JavaScript Engine
// a javascript engine is a program or an interpreter which executes javascript code
// A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard interpreter, or just-in-time compiler that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form.
/*
- A popular example of a JavaScript Engine is Googleâ€™s V8 engine. The V8 engine is used inside Chrome and Node.js for example.
- The engine consists of two main components   
    i. Memory heap - this is where the memory allocation happens
    ii. Call Stack - this is where your stack frames are as your code executes


- some asynchronous task is handled by browser web api like setTimeOut, setInterval
